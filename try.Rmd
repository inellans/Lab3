## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

HAPPY$POLVIEWS = HAPPY[HAPPY$POLVIEWS %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "POLVIEWS"] <- NA
HAPPY$SEX = HAPPY[HAPPY$SEX %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "SEX"] <- NA
HAPPY$MARITAL = HAPPY[HAPPY$MARITAL %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "MARITAL"] <- NA
HAPPY$DEGREE = HAPPY[HAPPY$DEGREE %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "DEGREE"] <- NA
HAPPY$FINRELA = HAPPY[HAPPY$FINRELA %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "FINRELA"] <- NA
HAPPY$HEALTH = HAPPY[HAPPY$HEALTH %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "HEALTH"] <- NA
HAPPY$PARTYID = HAPPY[HAPPY$PARTYID %in% c("IAP", "DK", "NA"), "PARTYID"] <- NA
HAPPY$SEX = as.factor(HAPPY$SEX)
HAPPY$MARITAL = as.factor(HAPPY$MARITAL)
HAPPY$DEGREE = as.factor(HAPPY$DEGREE)
HAPPY$FINRELA = as.factor(HAPPY$FINRELA)
HAPPY$HEALTH = as.factor(HAPPY$HEALTH)
HAPPY$PARTYID = as.factor(HAPPY$PARTYID)
HAPPY$POLVIEWS = as.factor(HAPPY$PARTYID)
HAPPY$SEX = levels(factor(HAPPY$SEX, levels=c("MALE", "FEMALE")))
HAPPY$DEGREE = levels(factor(HAPPY$DEGREE, levels=c("HIGH SCHOOL", "BACHELOR")))
HAPPY$FINRELA = levels(factor(HAPPY$FINRELA, levels=c("FAR ABOVE AVERAGE", "ABOVE AVERAGE", "AVERAGE", "BELOW AVERAGE", "FAR BELOW AVERAGE", "NA")))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(aes(x = HAPPY, y = SEX), data = HAPPY) + geom_point()
ggplot(HAPPY, aes(x = HAPPY)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~MARITAL)
```


Sex does not seem to have a large effect on happiness, as the plots for males and females seem to be fairly similar.

Marital status seems to have a positive effect on happiness leves, as the bar chart for happiness for married people has more mappy data.
